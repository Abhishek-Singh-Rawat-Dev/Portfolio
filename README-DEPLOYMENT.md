   - Added special bypass for the god page
   - Improved error handling in authentication flows

6. **Build Process**
   - Added TypeScript check skipping for faster builds
   - Fixed environment variable loading in deployment scripts
   - Created comprehensive deployment scripts

## Deployment Instructions

### Quick Deploy

1. Run the deployment script:
   ```
   ./deploy-fixed.sh
   ```

2. Deploy to Vercel:
   ```
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. After deployment, initialize your database:
   ```
   https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app/api/init
   ```

4. Access the god page:
   ```
   https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app/god
   ```
   Use passcode: `282499`

### Manual Steps

If you need to manually fix issues:

1. **Fix Prisma Client**:
   ```
   node fix-prisma.js
   ```

2. **Update Environment Variables**:
   - Set `DATABASE_URL` to your MongoDB connection string
   - Set `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` for JWT encryption
   - Note: `NEXTAUTH_URL` is now set dynamically

3. **Build the Project**:
   ```
   SKIP_TYPE_CHECK=1 npm run build
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Check your MongoDB Atlas connection string
   - Ensure IP whitelist includes Vercel's IPs (or set to allow all: 0.0.0.0/0)
   - Visit `/api/db-test` to diagnose connection problems

2. **Authentication Errors**:
   - If redirected to `/api/auth/error`, check the URL configuration
   - Visit `/api/diagnose-auth` for detailed diagnostics

3. **Build Failures**:
   - Run `node fix-prisma.js` to fix Prisma client issues
   - Check for TypeScript errors and consider using `SKIP_TYPE_CHECK=1`

## Admin Access

After deployment, you can access the admin dashboard with:
- Email: `admin@example.com`
- Password: `Admin@123`

Or use the god page with passcode: `282499`

## Environment Variables for Vercel

To deploy this portfolio project on Vercel, you need to set the following environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

```
# Database URL - MongoDB connection string
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/portfolio?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# NextAuth configuration 
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret-key

# Cloudinary for image uploads (if used)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
```

## Database Setup

After deploying to Vercel, you need to initialize your database with seed data. Visit the following endpoint:

```
https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/seed-db
```

This will create the initial resume data and theme settings required for the portfolio to function properly.

## Fixing API Issues

If you're seeing errors in your API endpoints (like 500 errors in /api/resume or /api/theme), check that:

1. The database is properly seeded using the seed-db endpoint
2. Your schema matches the Prisma models (if you see errors about invalid fields)
3. Your MongoDB instance is accessible from Vercel

## Admin Setup

To create an admin user for the dashboard:

```
https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/auth/register
```

This will create an admin user with:
- Email: adityapandey.dev.in@gmail.com
- Password: Admin@123

You can then log in to the admin dashboard at:

```
https://your-domain.vercel.app/admin
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Prisma on Vercel, make sure:

1. Your MongoDB connection string is correct
2. The MongoDB user has appropriate permissions
3. The IP address is allowed in your MongoDB network settings (or set to allow access from anywhere for testing)
4. The Prisma schema matches your API queries
