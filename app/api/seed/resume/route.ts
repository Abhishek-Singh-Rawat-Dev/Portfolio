        about: "I'm a dedicated second-year B.Tech Computer Science student at Graphic Era Hill University, passionate about exploring the digital world through code. My journey in technology is driven by curiosity and a desire to create solutions that make a difference. Currently, I'm focusing on mastering the MERN Stack while also exploring AI and ML technologies. I believe in continuous learning and pushing my boundaries to grow as a developer. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of web development and artificial intelligence, where I see tremendous potential for creating intelligent, user-friendly applications that solve real problems. When I'm not coding, you might find me binge-watching the latest shows, exploring new technologies, or engaging with the developer community â€“ because sometimes, the best debugging instincts come from unexpected places!",
